Blackjack Game Project in C++
The Blackjack project in C++ is a game designed to test the player's strategy and decision-making skills. 
In this game, the player competes against the dealer, aiming to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. 
The player can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). 
If the playerâ€™s hand exceeds 21, they lose automatically. 
The game incorporates various betting options, and the player's winnings depend on the outcome of the round.

The program implements classes to represent the game components, such as the player, dealer, and deck of cards. 
It also includes functions for game logic, such as dealing cards, calculating hand values, and determining the winner. 
User-defined data types are utilized to enhance the structure of the game. 
Additionally, the program employs loops and conditionals to create a logical flow of gameplay. 
The standard template library (STL) is used to manage collections of cards and other data structures efficiently.
